      description: `After another business restructuring, I was absorbed back into the Semikron-Danfoss team as 
      an IT Consultant within the MFG Services Build Delivery group. In this role, I was responsible for developing
      and assisting with an in-house MES system used across multiple manufacturing plants. This system was built
      using a combination of .NET, C#,  SQL, and Azure services to provide a robust and scalable solution for
      managing manufacturing operations.
      \n\n\n
      In particular my focus had been on developing a solution for a new piece of equipment that was being
      integrated into the production line. This involved working closely with the equipment vendor to understand
      the technical requirements and ensure seamless integration with the existing MES system. I also collaborated
      with cross-functional teams including production, quality assurance, and IT to gather requirements, design
      the solution, and implement the necessary changes. Throughout the project, I utilized Agile methodologies
      including Scrum to manage the development process, ensuring regular communication and collaboration among
      team members.
      \n\n\n
      Another primary focus I had was continuing development and improvements to an existing tool that I previously
      created during my time as a Manufacturing Engineer at Semikron-Danfoss. This tool was designed to streamline
      the process of tracking and managing production failures, and had been widely adopted across the entire plant.
      All while still continuing to work closely with the America's region of the IT Build Delivery team to ensure
      alignment with overall IT strategy and goals.
      \n\n\n
      My final focus in this role was to assist with the integration of remote services and monitoring solutions for
      the manufacturing equipment in our plant. Due to limited budget and resources, we were unable to utilize some
      traditional standards for remote connectivity. Instead we had to shift to using Secomea Gateways to provide secure
      remote access to the equipment. This involved configuring and managing the gateways, as well as administrating
      user access and permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
      \n\n\n
      While my time in this role had been short, due to our plant having to unfortunately close down, overall,
      my experience as an IT Consultant within the MFG Services Build Delivery group at Semikron-Danfoss has been
      incredibly rewarding. I've had the opportunity to work on challenging projects, collaborate with talented
      professionals, and contribute to the success of the organization.
